Lyrics Viewer
=============
An Android app to show the embedded lyrics of a music file.

It is based on [QuickLyric](https://github.com/geecko86/QuickLyric).
If you are looking for a more complete lyrics app, you should
definitely check it out.

This app does not connect to internet at all (does not even
request the permission). It does not download from lyrics sources.
If you want to use this app, you need to embed the lyrics yourself
to the music files manually, using a tag editor.

Because the lyrics are read from the music files, online music
streaming services are not supported.

It is only tested with the Google Play Music player.

Required Permissions

so that their lyrics can be extracted
